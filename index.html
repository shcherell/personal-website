        <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Successfully implemented Agile (SCRUM and Kanban) methodology at Hack The Publisher. Previously, teams worked in a disjointed manner without regular meetings or iteration planning. I treated this as a change management project, wrote clear instructions for the new work principles, conducted workshops, handled objections, and transitioned to the new work order over several iterations. The result was increased work efficiency, strengthened team spirit, and improved motivation.</li>
            <li>Simultaneously managed 3 projects. According to the company's goals, it was necessary to develop 3 projects simultaneously. One project had external funding, and 2 were internally funded. I planned the projects and key company resources. All projects were completed within budget and schedule. This required careful time management, competent delegation of some tasks, and high organization.</li>
            <li>Reduced the cost of online advertising conversion by more than 30% for a major supplier of home medical supplies. This was achieved by restructuring the website, fine-tuning analytics, changing advertising strategies, and conducting A/B testing.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="container" id="facts">
        <h2>Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Worked at Yandex (the largest Russian internet company with a matrix structure). Started as an account manager and was promoted to head of the commercial department in Kazakhstan.</li>
            <li>Organized the opening of a coffee shop (selection of location, supplier selection, construction supervision, staff recruitment, workspace organization).</li>
