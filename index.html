        <h2>Recent Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Centum</strong> - Narrative-driven adventure where everything may be a lie. Detail: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2625550/Centum/" target="_blank">Steam</a>
                <p>This project was developed by a distributed team consisting of an art director, 3 artists, 2 programmers, a sound designer, a game designer, a product owner, and a writer. External suppliers included a team of translators and testers, and the project was financed by an external investor. The project took 2 years to complete. We worked using milestones, employing SCRUM and Kanban methodologies. My role included making technical decisions during planning, planning milestones, decomposing tasks for each milestone, prioritizing tasks, budgeting, conducting regular team meetings, supporting the team, resolving conflicts, maintaining motivation, and organizing the testing process. I also communicated with service providers and integrated them into the workflow. Additionally, I actively participated in testing and was part of the game design team.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Vengeance of Mr. Peppermint</strong> - A 2D side-scrolling fighter with Korean thriller vibes. Detail: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287560/Vengeance_of_Mr_Peppermint/" target="_blank">Steam</a>
                <p>This project was developed by a distributed team consisting of an art director, 4 artists, one programmer, a product owner, a sound designer, and a translator. External service providers included testers. The project was financed by a publisher and lasted 1 year. The financing was milestone-based. My work included planning milestones, decomposing tasks, conducting regular meetings, supporting the team, preparing reports, presenting milestones to the publisher, gathering feedback, and managing the budget.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dwarven Skykeep</strong> - Strategic 2D base builder. Details: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1076120/Dwarven_Skykeep/" target="_blank">Steam</a>
                <p>This project was developed by a distributed team consisting of 3 artists, 3 programmers, 4 game designers, a narrative designer, a sound designer, and involved testers. The project was partially financed by a publisher and took 2 years to complete. The work was structured by milestones with intermediate releases. My work included organizing the distributed team's work, conducting regular meetings, maintaining team motivation, budget management, release management, preparing reports, presenting milestones to the publisher, gathering feedback, active testing, and participating in game design (I designed one of the game worlds).</p>
            </li>

    <div class="container" id="skills">
        <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Successfully implemented Agile (SCRUM and Kanban) methodology at Hack The Publisher. Previously, teams worked in a disjointed manner without regular meetings or iteration planning. I treated this as a change management project, wrote clear instructions for the new work principles, conducted workshops, handled objections, and transitioned to the new work order over several iterations. The result was increased work efficiency, strengthened team spirit, and improved motivation.</li>
            <li>Simultaneously managed 3 projects. According to the company's goals, it was necessary to develop 3 projects simultaneously. One project had external funding, and 2 were internally funded. I planned the projects and key company resources. All projects were completed within budget and schedule. This required careful time management, competent delegation of some tasks, and high organization.</li>
            <li>Reduced the cost of online advertising conversion by more than 30% for a major supplier of home medical supplies. This was achieved by restructuring the website, fine-tuning analytics, changing advertising strategies, and conducting A/B testing.</li>
        </ul>
